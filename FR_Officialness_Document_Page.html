Additionally as discussed in more detail below, the Exchange is also seeking the Commission's approval for DE Holdings [sic] proposal to, contemporaneously with the Closing, replace the Sixth DE Holdings LLC Agreement with the New DE Holdings LLC Agreement. Unlike the Sixth DE Holdings LLC Agreement, the New DE Holdings LLC Agreement will not contain the DE Holdings Ownership Limitation or the DE Holdings Voting Limitation. While the DE Holdings Ownership Limitation and the DE Holdings Voting Limitation will not be contained in the New DE Holdings LLC Agreement, the New DE Holdings LLC Agreement specifies that DE Holdings' only LLC Member will be New BGM,<sup><a rel="footnote" id="citation-28" href="#footnote-28">
            [28]
          </a></sup>

          <p id="p-60" data-page="76483">As a result, New BGM's acquisition of ownership and voting rights in DE Holdings upon Closing would not cause New BGM to contravene the DE Holdings Ownership Limitation or DE Holdings Voting Limitation, because the Sixth DE Holdings LLC Agreement will be contemporaneously amended to eliminate the DE Holdings Ownership Limitation and the DE Holdings Voting Limitation, and the New BGM Charter will be contemporaneously amended with respect to New BGM's stockholders.</p>
          <p id="p-61" data-page="76483">Nevertheless, because the Combination will result in a change of ownership of DE Holdings (in that New BGM will become the sole owner of DE Holdings), the Exchange and the Board of Managers of DE Holdings each believe that it is appropriate for the Board of Managers of DE Holdings to adopt the Resolutions, attached as Exhibit 5A, making certain determinations with respect to New BGM and the Combination similar to those that would be necessary to waive the DE Holdings Ownership Limitation and DE Holdings Voting Limitation.<sup><a rel="footnote" id="citation-30" href="#footnote-30">

          <p id="p-70" data-page="76483">The Board of Managers of DE Holdings also has determined that it has given due regard to the preservation of the independence of the self-regulatory function of each DE Exchange and to its obligations to investors and the general public, and determined that the actions to be taken pursuant to the Resolutions do not interfere with the effectuation of decisions by the board of each DE Exchange relating to its regulatory functions (including disciplinary<span class="printed_page" id="page-76484" data-page="76484"> </span>matters) or would not otherwise interfere with each DE Exchange's ability to carry out its responsibilities under the Act.</p>
          <p id="p-71" data-page="76484">The Exchange has reviewed such Resolutions and requests that the Commission approve such Resolutions. The Exchange believes that the Commission should approve the Resolutions, as the Combination will not impair the ability of either DE Exchange to carry out its functions and responsibilities under the Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or the ability of the Commission to enforce the Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. The DE Exchanges will continue to operate and regulate their markets and Members as they have done prior to the Combination. Thus, each DE Exchange will continue to enforce the Act, the Commission's rules thereunder, and each Exchange's own rules, in the manner it does today. Further, the Commission will continue to have plenary regulatory authority over the DE Exchanges, as is currently the case with these entities.</p>
          <p id="p-72" data-page="76484">The Exchange also notes that the Resolutions reflect the determination by the DE Holdings Board of Managers that the Combination and New BGM's resulting ownership and voting rights in DE Holdings are otherwise in the best interests of DE Holdings, its LLC Members, and the DE Exchanges.</p>
          <p id="p-73" data-page="76484">In addition, the Exchange notes that notwithstanding the Resolutions and the Combination, the DE Holdings Ownership Limitation and the DE Holdings Voting Limitation will remain in place with respect to potential future transactions involving the ultimate parent company of the DE Exchanges, New BGM. As described in more detail below, the Exchange is also proposing the adoption of the New BGM Charter and the New BGM Bylaws, which are modeled in large part on the Current BGM Charter and the Current BGM Bylaws (and include provisions substantially identical to the DE Holdings Ownership Limitation and the DE Holdings Voting Limitation), creating an ownership structure that will continue to provide the Commission with appropriate oversight tools to ensure that the Commission will have the ability to enforce the Act with respect to the Exchange, its direct and indirect parent entities, and its directors, officers, employees and agents to the extent they are involved in the activities of the Exchange, and protect the independence of the Exchange's self-regulatory activities.</p>
          <p id="p-74" data-page="76484">The Exchange therefore requests that the Commission approve the Resolutions, attached as Exhibit 5A.</p>

Therefore, neither its certificate of incorporation nor bylaws currently need or contain any provisions that would be appropriate for an entity that has direct or indirect ownership in a registered national securities exchange.</p>
          <p id="p-76" data-page="76484">However, in connection with the Combination, upon Closing, New BGM will become (i) the indirect owner (through BGM Holdings) of each of the BATS Exchanges and BATS Trading, (ii) the indirect owner (through DE Holdings and DEI) of each of the DE Exchanges, and (iii) the indirect owner (through DE Holdings) of DE Route. As a result, the Exchange is proposing that in connection with New BGM's acquisition of indirect ownership in the Exchange, New BGM would amend and restate each of its certificate of incorporation and bylaws to adopt provisions designed to protect and maintain the integrity of the self-regulatory functions of the Exchange and to facilitate the ability of the Exchange and the Commission to carry out their regulatory and oversight obligations under the Act. Each of the New BGM Charter and the New BGM Bylaws is modeled on, and substantially similar to, the Current BGM Charter and Current BGM Bylaws, respectively, except with respect to the differences described below. The Exchange is filing with the Commission the New BGM Charter and New BGM Bylaws because, after the Combination, New BGM will be the ultimate parent company of the Exchange, and, as such, the New BGM Charter and New BGM Bylaws will be considered rules of the Exchange under Section 19(b)(1) of the Act.<sup><a rel="footnote" id="citation-34" href="#footnote-34">

In addition, in contrast to the Current BGM Charter, the New BGM Charter would clarify that these same non-recognition and redemption rights apply in the case of a purported conversion of shares resulting in a violation of the BGM Ownership Limitation, as apply to purported sales, transfers, assignments, pledges or ownership that result in such a violation.<sup><a rel="footnote" id="citation-42" href="#footnote-42">

          <p id="p-93" data-page="76485">The provisions of the New BGM Charter differ from those of the Current BGM Charter in certain limited respects:</p>

The increase in authorized shares is due to the greater number of stockholders that New BGM will have following the Combination, as compared to Current BGM, as well as to provide an adequate number of authorized shares to allow for potential future issuances. The rights and preferences of the Class A Non-Voting Common Stock and Class B Non-Voting Common Stock are identical in all respects, except for conversion rights. Class A Non-Voting Common Stock converts into Voting Common Stock automatically upon transfer to a person other than a Related Person of such holder, upon termination of the Investor Rights Agreement, and may be converted into Voting Common Stock at any time at the option of the holder.<sup><a rel="footnote" id="citation-47" href="#footnote-47">

This provision parenthetically refers to the BATS Exchanges to reflect the fact that Current BGM is the direct owner of each of the BATS Exchanges. However, following the Combination, New BGM will instead be the direct owner of each of BGM Holdings and DE Holdings. The corresponding provision in the New BGM Bylaws therefore contains a similar parenthetical reference to its ownership of BGM Holdings and DE Holdings, rather than the BATS Exchanges.<sup><a rel="footnote" id="citation-65" href="#footnote-65">

Upon Closing, the Exchange's corporate family will include four separate exchanges, the two DE Exchanges and the two BATS Exchanges. Accordingly, the Exchange believes that it is important for each of the four exchanges to have a consistent, uniform approach to corporate governance. Therefore, to simplify and unify the governance and corporate practices of these four exchanges, the Exchange proposes to revise its Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws to conform them with the certificates of incorporation and bylaws of the BATS Exchanges. In addition, the Exchange proposes several amendments to the Exchange Bylaws that reflect changes that the BATS Exchanges propose to make to their bylaws as a result of the Combination.<sup><a rel="footnote" id="citation-115" href="#footnote-115">

The Exchange believes that the proposed changes to the Exchange Certificate of Incorporation and Exchange Bylaws are consistent with the requirements of the Act. Finally, in proposing these revisions to the Exchange Certificate of Incorporation and the Exchange Bylaws, the Exchange emphasizes that it believes that the Proposed Rule Change is not inconsistent with the Order Instituting Administrative and Cease-and-Desist Proceedings Pursuant to Sections 19(h) and 21C of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions and Cease-and-Desist Order, entered by the Commission on October 13, 2011.<sup><a rel="footnote" id="citation-116" href="#footnote-116">

            <p id="p-241" data-page="76494">Director who (i) is or has served in the prior three years as an officer, director, or employee of a broker or dealer, excluding an outside director or a director not engaged in the day-to-day management of a broker or dealer; (ii) is an officer, director (excluding an outside director), or employee of an entity that owns more than ten percent of the equity of a broker or dealer, and the broker or dealer accounts for more than five percent of the gross revenues received by the consolidated entity; (iii) owns more than five percent of the equity securities of any broker or dealer, whose investments in brokers or dealers exceed ten percent of his or her net worth, or whose ownership interest otherwise permits him or her to be engaged in the day-to-day management of a broker or dealer; (iv) provides professional services to brokers or dealers, and such services constitute 20 percent or more of the professional revenues received by the Director or 20 percent or more of the gross revenues received by the Director's firm or partnership; (v) provides professional services to a director, officer, or employee of a broker, dealer, or corporation that owns 50 percent or more of the voting stock of a broker or dealer, and such services relate to the director's, officer's, or employee's professional capacity and constitute 20 percent or more of the professional revenues received by the Director or member or 20 percent or more of the gross revenues received by the Director's or member's firm or partnership; or (vi) has a consulting or employment relationship with or provides professional services to the<span class="printed_page" id="page-76495" data-page="76495"> </span>Company or any affiliate thereof or has had any such relationship or provided any such services at any time within the prior three years.</p>
          </div>
          
          <p id="p-242" data-page="76495">Correspondingly, the term &ldquo;Non-Industry Director&rdquo; would be defined in Article I(v) as a Director who is (i) an Independent Director; or (ii) any other individual who would not be an Industry Director.</p>
          
          <p id="p-243" data-page="76495">With the proposed change in composition of the Board, the Exchange will now use the term &ldquo;Non-Industry Directors,&rdquo; as opposed to just &ldquo;Independent Directors.&rdquo; These two terms are comparable, although not identical. Article I(t) of the current Exchange Bylaws generally defines the term &ldquo;Independent Director&rdquo; as a Director who has no material relationship with the Exchange, an Affiliate<sup><a rel="footnote" id="citation-132" href="#footnote-132">
            [132]
          </a></sup>
            of the Exchange, a Member of the Exchange or an Affiliate of a Member of the Exchange, provided that an individual who otherwise qualifies as an Independent Director shall not be disqualified from serving in such capacity solely because such Director is a Director of the Exchange, DEI, DE Holdings or EDGA. In contrast, a Non-Industry Director is defined as an Independent Director or any other Director that does not satisfy one of the specific scenarios in the definition of Industry Director. Therefore, the Non-Industry Director may be somewhat broader than the definition of an Independent Director because it may include an individual with a material relationship with the Exchange, its Affiliate, or a Member of the Exchange or its Affiliate, provided that it does not satisfy the definition of an Industry Director.</p>
          
          <p id="p-245" data-page="76495">In addition, the Exchange proposes to eliminate the category of Owner Directors from its Board. An Owner Director is currently defined in Article I(w) as &ldquo;a Director nominated by a Designating Owner pursuant to Article III, Section 4(g) and elected by the stockholders of the Company.&rdquo; A &ldquo;Designating Owner,&rdquo; in turn, is defined in Article I(i) as &ldquo;a member of Direct Edge Holdings that holds (together with its Affiliates) at least a 15% Percentage Interest<sup><a rel="footnote" id="citation-133" href="#footnote-133">
            [133]
          </a></sup>
            (as defined in the [the Fourth DE Holdings LLC Agreement]) in Direct Edge Holdings.&rdquo; DE Holdings will only have one LLC Member after the Combination. Accordingly, the Exchange proposes to delete the definitions of &ldquo;Owner Director&rdquo; and &ldquo;Designating Owner&rdquo; from Article I, as well as all references to and provisions related to Owner Directors throughout the Bylaws.<sup><a rel="footnote" id="citation-134" href="#footnote-134">

          <p id="p-248" data-page="76495">Furthermore, the Exchange proposes to replace the term &ldquo;Exchange Member Director&rdquo; with the term &ldquo;Member Representative Director,&rdquo; and replace the existing definition of &ldquo;Exchange Member Director&rdquo; with the definition of &ldquo;Member Representative Director,&rdquo; as set forth in the bylaws of the BATS Exchanges. Although worded differently, the definitions of &ldquo;Exchange Member Director&rdquo; and &ldquo;Member Representative Director&rdquo; are substantively similar. Specifically, an Exchange Member Director is currently defined as an officer, director, employee or agent of an Exchange Member, other than an Owner Exchange Member, who is elected as a Director in accordance with the Bylaws. The Exchange proposes to define &ldquo;Member Representative Director&rdquo; as &ldquo;a Director who has been appointed as such to the initial Board of Directors pursuant to Article III, Section 4(g) of these Bylaws, or elected by stockholders after having been nominated by the Member Nominating Committee or by an Exchange Member pursuant to these Bylaws and confirmed as the nominee of Exchange Members after majority vote of Exchange Members, if applicable. A Member Representative Director must be an officer, director, employee or agent of an Exchange Member that is not a Stockholder Exchange Member.&rdquo;<sup><a rel="footnote" id="citation-135" href="#footnote-135">

          </p>
          
          <p id="p-250" data-page="76495">Second, the Exchange proposes to amend the manner in which the Board is divided into classes. Specifically, Section 3(b) currently states that &ldquo;The Board shall be divided into three (3) classes.&rdquo; The Exchange proposes to provide additional clarity, by revising this provision to states that &ldquo;Each of the Non-Industry and Industry Directors (excluding the Chief Executive Officer, but including Member Representative Directors) shall be divided into three (3) classes.&rdquo; In addition, the Exchange proposes to clarify in Section 3(b) that Directors&mdash;other than the Chief Executive Officer&mdash;will serve staggered three year terms.</p>
          <p id="p-251" data-page="76495">Third, the Exchange proposes to amend Section 5 of Article III regarding the Chairman of the Board to state that the Chief Executive Officer shall be the Chairman of the Board. Currently, the Chief Executive Officer may be, but is not required to be, the Chairman of the Board.</p>
          <p id="p-252" data-page="76495">Fourth, the Exchange proposes to revise the process for filling Board vacancies as set forth in Section 6 of Article III. Currently, under Sections 6(a) and (b), a majority of Directors then in office, though less than a quorum or a sole remaining Director, are required to elect the new Director that has been nominated by the Nominating and Governance Committee. The Exchange proposes to amend this provision to require the stockholder to elect the nominee. In addition, Section 6(b), which addresses vacancies for Member Representative Directors, would be revised to permit the Member Nominating Committee to recommend an individual or list of individuals to the stockholders from which the stockholders shall elect the new Director, rather than nominating a person for the vacancies. In addition, the Exchange proposes to delete the provisos in Section 6(a) and (b) that state that any vacancy resulting from the removal from office by a vote of the stockholders for cause may be filled by a vote of the stockholders at the same meeting at which such removal occurs. Without these two provisos, the Director vacancies must be filled in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 6(a) and (b). That is, the Nominating Committee must nominate, and the stockholders must elect, a person satisfying the classification (Industry, Non-Industry, or Independent Director), if applicable, for the directorship to fill such vacancy until the expiration of the remaining term or to fill such newly-created Director position until the expiration of such position's designated term. The revised Exchange Bylaws would not specifically address whether or not the removal and new election may occur in the same meeting. The Exchange believes that, with these proposed changes, the Exchange will continue to be so organized and have the capacity to be able to carry out the purposes of the Act and to comply and to enforce compliance by its Members and persons associated with its Members, with the provisions of the Act, the rules and regulations thereunder, and the Exchange Rules, as required by Section 6(b)(1) of the Act.<sup><a rel="footnote" id="citation-136" href="#footnote-136">

          </p>
          

          <p id="p-254" data-page="76495">Fifth, the Exchange Bylaws currently state in Section 2(d) of Article III that a Director will no longer qualify to be a Director upon a determination by the Board (i) that the Director no longer satisfies the classification for which the<span class="printed_page" id="page-76496" data-page="76496"> </span>Director was elected; and (ii) that the Director's continued service would violate the compositional requirements of the Board set forth in Article III, Section 2(b). The Exchange proposes to move this provision to new Section 7(b) and to revise the language to clarify that, under these two scenarios, the Director will be removed immediately upon determination of the Board by a majority vote of the remaining Directors.</p>
          <p id="p-255" data-page="76496">Sixth, the Exchange proposes to amend Section 7(b) (to be renumbered Section 7(c)) to permit a Director to resign upon notice of resignation to the Chairman, the President or Secretary, rather than the Chairman, Chief Executive Officer or Secretary, as the Proposed Rule Change would require that the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer be the same person.</p>
          <p id="p-256" data-page="76496">Seventh, the Exchange proposes to amend Section 10(a) of Article III regarding special meetings to permit the President to call a special meeting. Under the current Bylaws, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer are authorized to do so. However, with the revisions pursuant to this Proposed Rule Change, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer will be the same person. To continue to ensure that at least two different persons may call a special meeting, the Exchange proposes to permit the President in addition to the Chairman to call such meetings. The Commission has previously found this consistent with the Act as it is part of the current bylaws of the BATS Exchanges. Furthermore, the Exchange proposes to add language to paragraph (b) of Section 10 to describe the process for providing notice of special meetings to each Director. Specifically, Section 10 would state that notice of any special meeting shall be given to each Director at his or her business address or such other address as he or she may have advised the Secretary to use for such purpose. If delivered, notice shall be deemed to be given when delivered to such address or to the Director to be notified. If mailed, such notice shall be deemed to be given five business days after deposit in the United States mail, postage prepaid, of a letter addressed to the appropriate location. Notice may also be given by telephone, electronic transmission or other means not specified in this section, and in each such case shall be deemed to be given when actually received by the Director to be notified.</p>
          <p id="p-257" data-page="76496">Eighth, current Section 12 of Article III defines a quorum for the transaction of business as a majority of the number of Directors then in office, but in no event less than1/3of the total number of Directors. The Exchange proposes to eliminate from the quorum calculation the minimum requirement of1/3of the total number of Directors.</p>
          <p id="p-258" data-page="76496">Ninth, the Exchange also proposes to add to Article III a new Section 13, entitled &ldquo;Presumption of Assent.&rdquo; It would state that a Director of the Exchange who is present at a duly convened meeting of the Board or of a committee of the Board at which action on any corporate matter is taken shall be conclusively presumed to have assented to the action taken unless his or her dissent or election to abstain shall be entered in the minutes of the meeting or unless he or she shall file his or her written dissent or election to abstain to such action with the person acting as the secretary of the meeting before the adjournment of the meeting or shall forward such dissent or election to abstain by registered or certified mail to the Secretary of the Exchange immediately after the adjournment of the meeting. Such right to dissent or abstain shall apply to a Director who voted in favor of such action.</p>
          <p id="p-259" data-page="76496">Tenth, the Exchange proposes to add to Article III a new Section 17,<sup><a rel="footnote" id="citation-137" href="#footnote-137">
            [137]
          </a></sup>
            which would state that the Board shall have the power to interpret the Exchange Bylaws and any interpretation made by it shall be final and conclusive.</p>
          
          <p id="p-261" data-page="76496">Finally, the Exchange proposes several amendments to current Section 16, entitled Conflicts of Interest; Contracts and Transactions Involving Directors, and to renumber it as Section 18. Section 16(a) currently states that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, a Director or a member of any committee may not participate in consideration or decision of any matter relating to a particular Member or Person if such Director or committee member has a material interest in, or a professional, business or personal relationship with, that Member or other Person, or if such participation shall create an appearance of impropriety. The Exchange proposes to add to this provision the statement that &ldquo;[i]n any such case, the Director or committee member shall recuse himself or herself or shall be disqualified. If a member of the Board or any committee is recused from consideration of a matter, any decision on the matter shall be by a vote of a majority of the remaining members of the Board or applicable committee.&rdquo; In addition, the Exchange proposes to delete the following statement from this paragraph: &ldquo;Exchange Member Directors shall not be deemed to be personally interested in the determination of matters that may affect the Exchange Members as a whole or certain groups of Exchange Members, and Exchange Member Directors shall not be prohibited from participating in such determinations in the normal course of conducting the Exchange's business.&rdquo;</p>
          <p id="p-262" data-page="76496">In addition, paragraph (b) of this Section addresses Exchange contracts and transactions involving Directors and officers. Specifically, this paragraph currently states that:</p>
          
          <div class="extract">
            <p id="p-263" data-page="76496">No contract or transaction between the [Exchange] and one or more of its Directors or officers, or between the [Exchange] and any other corporation, partnership, association, or other organization in which one or more of its Directors or officers are directors or officers, or have a financial interest, shall be void or voidable solely for this reason, or solely because the director or officer is present at or participates in the meeting of the Board or committee which authorizes the contracts or transaction, or solely because any such Director's or officer's votes are counted for such purpose, if (i) the material facts pertaining to such Director's or officer's relationship or interest and as to the contract or transactions are disclosed or are known to the Board or the committee, and the Board or committee in good faith authorizes the contract or transaction by the affirmative vote of a majority of the disinterested Directors, even though the disinterested Directors be less than a quorum; (ii) the material facts as to the Director's or officer's relationship or interest and as to the contract or transaction are disclosed or are known to the stockholders entitled to vote thereon, and the contract or transaction is specifically approved in good faith by vote of the stockholders; or (iii) the contract or transaction is fair as to the [Exchange] as of the time it is authorized, approved or ratified, by the Board, a committee or the stockholders.</p>
          </div>
          
          <p id="p-264" data-page="76496">The Exchange proposes to delete the phrase &ldquo;or solely because the director or officer is present at or participates in the meeting of the Board or committee which authorizes the contracts or transaction, or solely because any such Director's or officer's votes are counted for such purpose,&rdquo; as well as clause (iii). In addition, the Exchange proposes to amend clause (ii) to state &ldquo;the material facts are disclosed or become known to the Board or committee after the contract or transaction is entered into, and the Board or committee in good faith ratifies the contract or transaction by the affirmative vote of a majority of disinterested Directors, even though the disinterested Directors be less than a quorum.&rdquo; With these changes, paragraph (b) will be consistent with the bylaws of the BATS Exchanges.</p>

          <p id="p-265" data-page="76496">The changes to these provisions of the Exchange Bylaws relating to the Board of Directors will permit the Exchange to continue to be so organized and have<span class="printed_page" id="page-76497" data-page="76497"> </span>the capacity to be able to carry out the purpose of the Act and to comply and to enforce compliance by its Members and persons associated with its Members, with the provisions of the Act, the rules and regulations thereunder, and the Exchange Rules, as required by Section 6(b)(1) of the Act.<sup><a rel="footnote" id="citation-138" href="#footnote-138">

          <p id="p-267" data-page="76497">The Exchange proposes several minor changes to Article IV of the Exchange Bylaws, which describes matters related to the stockholders of the Exchange.</p>
          <ul class="bullets">
<li id="p-268" data-page="76497"> The Exchange proposes to amend Section 2 to permit the Chairman, Board or the President to call a special meeting of the stockholders, rather than the Chairman, Board or Chief Executive Officer.</li>

          <li id="p-274" data-page="76497"> The Exchange proposes to amend the process for the appointment and removal of committee members, as well as the committee composition, as set forth in Section 2(a). The existing Bylaws require the Board, after consultation with the Chairman, to appoint committee members, and the Board to remove committee members. The Exchange proposes to require the Chairman, with the approval of the Board, to appoint committee members, and to permit the Chairman, with the approval of the Board, to remove committee members.<sup><a rel="footnote" id="citation-139" href="#footnote-139">

            Correspondingly, the Chairman, rather than the Board, would be responsible for determining whether committees meet the applicable compositional requirements. In addition, under Article V, Section 2(a) of the current Exchange Bylaws, each committee must be comprised of at least three members of the Board, with a majority of Independent Directors (although Article V, Section 5(a) and (c) of the current Exchange Bylaws additionally require that the Regulatory Oversight Committee and Compensation Committee consist solely of Independent Directors). The Exchange proposes to require that each committee be comprised of at least three people and may include persons who are not members of the Board. Other proposed provisions of Article V would provide additional requirements for the composition of the various committees. For example, proposed Article V, Section 6(a) would require each voting member of the Compensation Committee to be a Non-Industry Director, and proposed Article V, Section 6(c) would require that each member of the Regulatory Oversight Committee be a Non-Industry Director. Furthermore, the revised Bylaws would clarify that committee members who are not also Board members shall only participate in committee actions to the extent permitted by law. Finally, the Exchange proposes to eliminate the statement that &ldquo;[t]he Board, after consultation with the Chairman, may designate one or more Directors as alternate members of any committee who may replace any absent or disqualified member at any meeting of the committee. Except as otherwise set forth in these Bylaws, the Board, after consultation with the Chairman, may have non-voting observers attend committee meetings.&rdquo;</li>

In addition, the Secretary would be required to certify to the Board each prospective committee member's classification.

Specifically, the Exchange proposes to define an Independent member as &ldquo;a member of any committee who has no material relationship with the Company or any affiliate of the Company, or any Exchange Member or any affiliate of any such Exchange Member, other than as a committee member. The term Independent member may, but is not required to, refer to an Independent Director who serves on a committee.&rdquo; In addition, the Exchange proposes to define an Industry member in Article I(p) as &ldquo;a member of any committee or hearing panel who (i) is or has served in the prior three years as an officer, director, or employee of a broker or dealer, excluding an outside director or a director not engaged in the day-to-day management of a broker or dealer; (ii) is an officer, director (excluding an outside director), or employee of an entity that owns more than ten percent of the equity of a broker or dealer, and the broker or dealer accounts for more than five percent of the gross revenues received by the consolidated entity; (iii) owns more than five percent of the equity securities of any broker or dealer, whose investments in brokers or dealers exceed ten percent of his or her net worth, or whose ownership interest otherwise permits him or her to be engaged in the day-to-day management of a broker or dealer; (iv) provides professional services to brokers or dealers, and such services constitute 20 percent or more of the professional revenues received by the Director or 20 percent or more of the gross revenues received by the Director's firm or partnership; (v) provides professional services to a director, officer, or employee of a broker, dealer, or corporation that owns 50 percent or more of the voting stock of a broker or dealer, and such services relate to the director's, officer's, or employee's professional capacity and constitute 20 percent or more of the professional<span class="printed_page" id="page-76498" data-page="76498"> </span>revenues received by the Director or member or 20 percent or more of the gross revenues received by the Director's or member's firm or partnership; or (vi) has a consulting or employment relationship with or provides professional services to the Company or any affiliate thereof or has had any such relationship or provided any such services at any time within the prior three years.&rdquo;</li>

In addition, each member of the Compensation Committee would be a Non-Industry Director, rather than an Independent Director. Moreover, the Exchange would eliminate (1) the requirement that the committee have three members; (2) the requirement that the Compensation Committee assist the Board in fulfilling its responsibilities to ensure the structures of compensation systems of the Exchange do not interfere with the Exchange's ability to fulfill its responsibilities as an SRO; and (3) the statement that the Board, after consultation with the Chairman, may designate non-voting observers who shall be permitted to attend and participate in committee meetings.</li>

Specifically, the Chairman, with the approval of the Board, would appoint the Audit Committee, rather than the Board, after consultation with the Chairman. In addition, a majority of the members of the Audit Committee would be Non-Industry Directors, rather than Independent Directors. A Non-Industry Director, rather than an Independent Director, would serve as the Chairman of the Audit Committee. Moreover, the Exchange proposes to eliminate the following Audit Committee responsibilities: (1) Assist the Board in fulfilling its responsibilities to oversee the financial soundness and compliance resources and the effectiveness of financial and compliance control processes related to the operation of the Exchange; (2) take appropriate actions to oversee overall corporate policy for quality activities and reporting of a SRO, sound business risk management practices and ethical behavior; (3) provide oversight over the technology and information integrity established by management and the Board; (4) selecting and replacing and determining the compensation of the head of the Internal Audit Department (or if such position is outsourced, of the third party service provider) in consultation with management; and (5) overseeing enterprise risk and technology operations, including security and business continuity measures. The Exchange also proposes to add the parenthetical &ldquo;(or nominate the independent auditors to be proposed for ratification by stockholders)&rdquo; to the function of selecting, evaluating, and where appropriate, replacing the Company's independent auditor. The Exchange also would clarify that the Audit Committee had &ldquo;exclusive&rdquo; authority to perform certain functions, including hiring the Exchange's Internal Audit Department, determining the compensation of the head of the Internal Audit Department and determining the budget for the Internal Audit Department. Finally, the Exchange would eliminate the statement in this Section that nothing in this Section shall prohibit or be deemed to be in conflict with the ability of the Exchange to retain a third party to perform all or a portion of its audit function, provided that the Exchange shall supervise and have primary responsibility for any action undertaken by a third party auditor retained to perform such audit functions.</li>

In addition, each member of the Regulatory Oversight Committee would be a Non-Industry Director, rather than an Independent Director.</li>
          <li id="p-285" data-page="76498"> The Exchange proposes to amend the provisions regarding the appointment and composition of the Appeals Committee in Section 5(d) (to be renumbered as Section 6(d)). Specifically, the Chairman, with the approval of the Board, would appoint the Appeals Committee, rather than the Board, after consultation with the Chairman. In addition, the Appeals Committee would no longer consist of two Independent Directors and one Exchange Member Director. Instead, the Appeals Committee would consist of one Independent Director, one Industry Director, and one Member Representative Director. If the Independent Director recuses himself or herself from an appeal, due to a conflict of interest or otherwise, such Independent Director may be replaced by a Non-Industry Director for purposes of the applicable appeal if there is no other Independent Director able to serve as a replacement.</li>
          <li id="p-286" data-page="76498"> The Exchange proposes to amend Section 5(e) (to be renumbered as Section 6(e)) regarding the Executive Committee in two ways. Specifically, the Chairman, with the approval of the Board, would appoint the Executive Committee, rather than the Board, after consultation with the Chairman. In addition, the Exchange would add the requirement that the number of Non-Industry Directors on the Executive Committee equal or exceed the number of Industry Directors on the Executive Committee.</li>
          <li id="p-287" data-page="76498"> The Exchange proposes to add Section 6(f), stating that the Chairman, with the approval of the Board, may appoint a Finance Committee. If appointed, the Finance Committee will advise the Board with respect to the oversight of the financial operations and conditions of the Exchange, including recommendations for the Exchange's annual operating and capital budgets.</li>
</ul>

          <p id="p-288" data-page="76498">The changes to these provisions of the Exchange Bylaws relating to committees of the Board will permit the Exchange<span class="printed_page" id="page-76499" data-page="76499"> </span>to continue to be so organized and have the capacity to be able to carry out the purpose of the Act and to comply and to enforce compliance by its Members and persons associated with its Members, with the provisions of the Act, the rules and regulations thereunder, and the Exchange Rules, as required by Section 6(b)(1) of the Act.<sup><a rel="footnote" id="citation-141" href="#footnote-141">

          <p id="p-290" data-page="76499">The Exchange also proposes to amend Article VI regarding the Nominating Committees of the Exchange.<sup><a rel="footnote" id="citation-142" href="#footnote-142">
            [142]
          </a></sup>
            To conform the requirements regarding the Exchange's Nominating and Governance Committee with that of the BATS Exchanges, the Exchange proposes to rename the Nominating and Governance Committee the &ldquo;Nominating Committee.&rdquo;<sup><a rel="footnote" id="citation-143" href="#footnote-143">
            [143]
          </a></sup>
            In addition, the Exchange would change the composition of this Committee from a committee of three Independent Directors, to a committee in which the number of Non-Industry members equals or exceeds the number of Industry members. The Exchange also proposes to streamline the responsibilities of this Committee by eliminating the following responsibilities from the Committee's purview: (1) Developing and recommending governance policies to the Board; (2) nominating chairpersons to serve on committees of the Board; (3) overseeing an annual self-evaluation of the independent Directors and Board committees; (4) overseeing the implementation and effectiveness of the Bylaws, committee charters, policies and other governance documents as needed; (5) reviewing and recommending best practices in corporate governance; and (6) overseeing an orientation for new Directors. Finally, the Exchange proposes to add to Section 2 that a Nominating Committee member may simultaneously serve on the Nominating Committee and the Board, unless the Nominating Committee is nominating Director candidates for the Director's class. Notwithstanding the prior sentence, a Director may serve on the Nominating Committee in his or her final year of service on the Board. Following that year, that member may not stand for election to the Board until such time as he or she is no longer a member of the Nominating Committee.</p>
          
          
          <p id="p-293" data-page="76499">The Exchange also proposes to amend the description of the Exchange Member Nominating Committee, as set forth in Section 3 of Article VI. First, the Exchange proposes to change the name of the &ldquo;Exchange Member Nominating Committee&rdquo; to &ldquo;Member Nominating Committee.&rdquo;<sup><a rel="footnote" id="citation-144" href="#footnote-144">
            [144]

            Second, the Member Nominating Committee will continue to nominate candidates for Exchange Member Directors (to be renamed the &ldquo;Member Representative Director&rdquo;) position on the Board that is to be elected by Exchange Member or stockholders, but will no longer be tasked with the obligation to nominate candidates for &ldquo;all other vacant or new Exchange Member Director positions on the Board.&rdquo; Third, the Exchange would amend the description of the composition of this Committee by changing the committee member qualification requirement from &ldquo;an Exchange Member Director, except that such committee member is not required to be a Director&rdquo; to &ldquo;a Member Representative member.&rdquo; Fourth, the Exchange proposes to delete the provisions regarding the process for confirming whether a prospective committee member satisfies such member's classification requirements, and move such provisions to Article V, Section 2(b).</p>
          
          <h4 id="h-24" class="">(V) Officers, Agents and Employees</h4>
          <p id="p-295" data-page="76499">The Exchange proposes the following amendments to Article VII of the Exchange Bylaws, which sets forth various requirements regarding the officers, agents and employees of the Exchange.</p>
          <ul class="bullets">
<li id="p-296" data-page="76499"> The Exchange proposes to revise Section 1 to require that the Exchange have a President, Secretary and Treasurer in addition to the currently required Chief Executive Officer and Chief Regulatory Officer. In addition, the Exchange proposes to prohibit the same person from holding the offices of both the President and the Secretary. Currently, this prohibition applies to the offices of the Chief Executive Officer and the Secretary.</li>
          <li id="p-297" data-page="76499"> The Exchange proposes to amend Section 3(a) of Article VII to permit an officer to provide his or her resignation to the President in addition to the Chairman, Chief Executive Officer or the Secretary. The Exchange also proposes the corresponding amendment to Section 3(a) to provide that an officer could no longer provide such resignation to a designee of the Board, if no such officers are then appointed. In addition, the Exchange proposes to add Section 3(c), which would state that vacancies in any office of the Exchange may be filled for the unexpired term by the Board.</li>
          <li id="p-298" data-page="76499"> The Exchange proposes to amend Section 4 of Article VII regarding officer compensation to reflect the proposed change to Article V, Section 6(c) of the Exchange Bylaws regarding the compensation of the Chief Regulatory Officer. Specifically, the Exchange proposes to add the phrase &ldquo;Except as otherwise provided in Article V, Section 6(c) of these Bylaws,&rdquo; to the statement that the salaries of all other officers and agents of the Company shall be fixed by the Chief Executive Officer, in consultation with the Compensation Committee.</li>
          <li id="p-299" data-page="76499"> The Exchange proposes to amend Section 6 of Article VII regarding the Chief Executive Officer to state that the Chief Executive Officer shall be the Chairman of the Board and &ldquo;shall preside at all meetings of the Board at which the Chief Executive Officer is present; provided, however, that he or she shall not participate in executive sessions&rdquo; of the Board.</li>
          <li id="p-300" data-page="76499"> Section 7 of Article VII (to be renumbered Section 9) regarding the Chief Regulatory Officer would be revised to require the Chief Regulatory Officer to be an officer of the Exchange with the position of Executive Vice President or Senior Vice President.</li>
          <li id="p-301" data-page="76499"> Section 8 of Article VII (to be renumbered Section 10) regarding the Secretary would be revised to state that the President, in addition to the Board and Chief Executive Officer, may assign duties to the Secretary. The President's ability to do so comports with the responsibilities as set forth in new proposed Section 7, as discussed below.</li>

          <li id="p-302" data-page="76499"> The Exchange proposes to add new Sections 7, 8, 11, 12 and 13 to Article VII of the Exchange Bylaws describing the responsibilities of the President, Vice President, Assistant Secretary, Treasurer and Assistant Treasurer, respectively. Specifically, Section 7 would state the following: &ldquo;The President shall, in the absence of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, preside at all meetings of the Board at which the President is present. The<span class="printed_page" id="page-76500" data-page="76500"> </span>President shall have general supervision over the operations of the Company. The President shall have all powers and duties usually incident to the office of the President, except as specifically limited by a resolution of the Board. The President shall exercise such other powers and perform such other duties as may be assigned to the President from time to time by the Board.&rdquo;</li>
          <li id="p-303" data-page="76500"> In addition, Section 8 of Article VII regarding Vice Presidents would read as follows:</li>
</ul>
          
          <div class="extract">
            <p id="p-304" data-page="76500">The Board shall appoint one or more Vice Presidents. In the absence or disability of the President or if the office of President becomes vacant, the Vice Presidents in the order determined by the Board, or if no such determination has been made, in the order of their seniority, shall perform the duties and exercise the powers of the President, subject to the right of the Board at any time to extend or restrict such powers and duties or to assign them to others. Any Vice President may have such additional designations in such Vice President's title as the Board may determine. The Vice Presidents shall generally assist the President in such manner as the President shall direct. Each Vice President shall exercise such other powers and perform such other duties as may be assigned to such Vice President from time to time by the Board, the Chief Executive Officer or the President. The term &ldquo;Vice President&rdquo; used in this Section shall include the positions of Executive Vice President, Senior Vice President, and Vice President.</p>
          </div>
          
          <ul class="bullets">
<li id="p-305" data-page="76500"> Furthermore, new Section 11 of Article VII would describe the responsibilities of an Assistant Secretary as follows: &ldquo;In the absence of the Secretary or in the event of the Secretary's inability or refusal to act, any Assistant Secretary, approved by the Board, shall exercise all powers and perform all duties of the Secretary. An Assistant Secretary shall also exercise such other powers and perform such other duties as may be assigned to such Assistant Secretary from time to time by the Board or the Secretary.&rdquo;</li>
          <li id="p-306" data-page="76500"> In addition, Section 12 of Article VII, regarding Treasurers, would state:</li>
</ul>
          
          <div class="extract">
            <p id="p-307" data-page="76500">The Treasurer shall have general supervision over the care and custody of the funds and over the receipts and disbursements of the Company and shall cause the funds of the Company to be deposited in the name of the Company in such banks or other depositories as the Board may designate. The Treasurer shall have supervision over the care and safekeeping of the securities of the Company. The Treasurer shall have all powers and duties usually incident to the office of Treasurer except as specifically limited by a resolution of the Board. The Treasurer shall exercise such other powers and perform such other duties as may be assigned to the Treasurer from time to time by the Board, the Chief Executive Officer or the President.</p>
          </div>
          
          <p id="p-308" data-page="76500">Finally, new Section 13 of Article VII would describe the role of the Assistant Treasurer. Specifically, it would state that &ldquo;In the absence of the Treasurer or in the event of the Treasurer's inability or refusal to act, any Assistant Treasurer, approved by the Board, shall exercise all powers and perform all duties of the Treasurer. An Assistant Treasurer shall also exercise such other powers and perform such other duties as may be assigned to such Assistant Treasurer from time to time by the Board or the Treasurer.&rdquo;</p>
          <h4 id="h-25" class="">(VI) Indemnification</h4>
          <p id="p-309" data-page="76500">The Exchange also proposes to make certain amendments to the indemnification provisions set forth in Section 1 of Article VIII of the Exchange Bylaws, including the following:</p>
          <ul class="bullets">
<li id="p-310" data-page="76500"> The Exchange proposes to revise paragraph (a) (to be renumbered (b)). First, this paragraph would state that the Exchange shall advance to any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed proceeding of any kind by reason of the fact that he is or was a Director or executive officer of the Exchange or is or was serving at the request of the Exchange as a Director or executive officer of another entity, prior to the final disposition of such proceeding, all expenses incurred by such person in such proceeding upon receipt of such person's undertaking to repay amounts if it should be determined ultimately that such person is not entitled to be indemnified. The Exchange would add a second paragraph to this renumbered paragraph (b) stating that in general no advance shall be made by the Exchange to an executive officer of the Exchange (except by reason of the fact that such executive officer is or was a Director of the Exchange in which event this paragraph shall not apply) in any proceeding of any kind if a determination is reasonably and promptly made (i) by the Board of Directors by a majority vote of a quorum of directors who were not parties to the proceeding, or (ii) if such quorum is not obtainable, or, even if obtainable, a quorum of disinterested Directors so directs, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, that the facts demonstrate clearly and convincingly that such person acted in bad faith or in a manner that such person did not believe to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Exchange.</li>
          <li id="p-311" data-page="76500"> The Exchange proposes to delete paragraph (c) and replace it in its entirety. Paragraph (c) currently states that, if a claim for indemnification (following the final disposition of such proceeding) or advancement of expenses under Article VIII is not paid in full within thirty days after a written claim by the applicable person has been received by the Exchange, such person may file suit to recover the unpaid amount and, if successful shall be entitled to be paid the expense of prosecuting such claim to the fullest extent permitted by law. In any such action the Exchange shall have the burden of proving that such person is not entitled to the indemnification or advancement of expenses under applicable law. The revised paragraph (c) would state that any right to indemnification or advances granted by Article VIII is enforceable by or on behalf of the person holding such right if (i) the claim for indemnification or advances is denied, in whole or in part, or (ii) no disposition of such claim is made within ninety (90) days of request therefor. The claimant, if successful in whole or in part, shall also be entitled to be paid expenses relating to prosecuting his claim.</li>
          <li id="p-312" data-page="76500"> The Exchange proposes to revise paragraph (f) (to be renumbered paragraph (e)) to clarify that the rights conferred on any person by Article VIII continue as to a person who has ceased to be a Director or executive officer of the Exchange.</li>
          <li id="p-313" data-page="76500"> The Exchange proposes to amend paragraph (k) (to be renumbered paragraph (i)) by adding two new paragraphs. The first new paragraph states that the term &ldquo;proceeding&rdquo; shall be broadly construed. The second new paragraph provides that references to a &ldquo;director,&rdquo; &ldquo;officer,&rdquo; &ldquo;employee,&rdquo; or &ldquo;agent&rdquo; of the Exchange shall include, without limitation, situations where such person is serving at the request of the Exchange as a director, officer, employee, trustee or agent of another entity.</li>
          <li id="p-314" data-page="76500"> The Exchange also proposes to make certain additional amendments to Article VIII of the Exchange Bylaws that are not material and will not impair the ability of (1) the Exchange to carry out its functions and responsibilities under the Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder or (2) the Commission to enforce the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder.</li>

          <h4 id="h-26" class="">(VII) Miscellaneous Provisions</h4>
          <p id="p-315" data-page="76500">The Exchange proposes to make the following amendments to Article XI of the Exchange Bylaws:</p>

          <h4 id="h-28" class="">(ii) Changes To Conform to the BATS Exchanges' Proposed Changes to the Existing Bylaws in Connection With the Combination</h4>
          <p id="p-349" data-page="76502">In addition to the changes discussed above, the Exchange proposes to make the following amendments to the Exchange Bylaws, which are consistent with the changes proposed to be made by the BATS Exchanges in connection with the Combination:</p>
          <ul class="bullets"><li id="p-350" data-page="76502"> Adding new Section 2(b) and amending Section 3(b) of Article III of the Exchange Bylaws to clarify that the Chief Executive Officer of the Exchange is considered to be an Industry Director, but is excluded from being designated as a member of one of the three classes of directors for purposes of the Board's staggered three-year terms. The Exchange understands that the BATS Exchanges have proposed this amendment to clarify, rather than change, their current practice. The revised Exchange Bylaws require that the Board of Directors be composed of one Director who is the Chief Executive Officer of the Exchange, and a sufficient number of Non-Industry Directors (including Independent Directors), Industry Directors and Member Representative Directors such that (i) the number of Non-Industry Directors, including at least one Independent Director, equals or exceeds the sum of the number of Industry Directors and Member Representative Directors, and (ii) the number of Member Representative Directors equals at least 20 percent of the Board of Directors (the &ldquo;Exchange Board Composition Requirements&rdquo;).<sup><a rel="footnote" id="citation-150" href="#footnote-150">
            [150]
          </a></sup>
            Because the definition of &ldquo;Industry Director&rdquo; includes a Director that has an employment relationship with the Exchange,<sup><a rel="footnote" id="citation-151" href="#footnote-151">
            [151]
          </a></sup>
            the Chief Executive Officer of the Exchange will always meet the definition of &ldquo;Industry Director.&rdquo; Consistent with this definition, and in order to effectuate the Exchange Board Composition Requirements, the Exchange considers the Chief Executive Officer to be an Industry Director. Were the Chief Executive Officer to not be considered for purpose of determining composition of the board, the total number of persons affiliated with the securities industry (including Industry Directors, Member Representative Directors and the Chief Executive Officer) could potentially exceed the number of Non-Industry Directors&mdash;a result that the Exchange believes the Exchange Board Composition Requirements were intended to prevent. The Exchange therefore proposes to add new Section 2(b) of Article III of the Exchange Bylaws to explicitly clarify that the Chief Executive Officer shall be considered to be an Industry Director. The Exchange Bylaws separately provide that each of the Non-Industry Directors and Industry Directors are divided into one of three classes to serve staggered three-year terms.<sup><a rel="footnote" id="citation-152" href="#footnote-152">
            [152]
          </a></sup>
            Unlike other Industry Directors, rather than serving a three-year term, the Chief Executive Officer of the Exchange serves on the Board of Directors until he or she ceases to be Chief Executive Officer.<sup><a rel="footnote" id="citation-153" href="#footnote-153">
            [153]
          </a></sup>
            The Exchange is therefore proposing to amend Section 3(b) of Article III of the Exchange Bylaws to explicitly clarify that the reference to each Industry Director serving a staggered three-year term excludes the Chief Executive Officer.</li></ul>
          
          
          
          
          <ul class="bullets">
<li id="p-355" data-page="76502"> Amending Section 4(a), Section 4(c) and Section 4(e) of Article III of the Exchange Bylaws to permit the Director nomination and election process (including the Member Representative Director nomination and election process conducted by the Member Nominating Committee) to be conducted through either an annual or special meeting of stockholders, rather than solely through an annual meeting of stockholders. Without this change, should one or more vacancies on the Board of Directors occur, the vacancies would continue until they can be filled at an annual meeting. As a result, vacancies that arise soon after an annual meeting could remain for close to a full year. The Exchange therefore proposes to amend the Exchange Bylaws to add flexibility to the governance process around the nomination and election of a Director position that may become vacant at a time that does not coincide with the Exchange's annual director election process, by permitting the process to occur at any time via a special meeting of stockholders.</li>
          <li id="p-356" data-page="76502"> Amending Section 2(a) of Article V of the Exchange Bylaws to clarify that the Chairman, with the approval of the Board, not only appoints the members of all committees of the Board, but also the chair of each committee. The Exchange understands that this amendment is intended to reflect the current committee and committee Chair appointment processes utilized by the BATS Exchanges.</li>
          <li id="p-357" data-page="76502"> Amending Section 6(c) of Article V of the Exchange Bylaws to clarify that the Regulatory Oversight Committee responsibilities include, in consultation with the Chief Executive Officer of the Exchange, establishing the goals, assessing the performance, and fixing the compensation of the Chief Regulatory Officer of the Company. These amendments are intended to reflect the current responsibilities of the Regulatory Oversight Committee for the Exchange.</li>

          <li id="p-358" data-page="76502"> Expanding the prohibition contained in Section 2 of Article XI of the Exchange Bylaws. Currently, Section 2 prohibits DEI and DE Holdings directors, officers, employees, agents or advisors who are not also directors, officers, staff, counsel or advisors of the Exchange from participating in any meetings of the Exchange's Board of Directors (or any committee thereof) pertaining to the self-regulatory function of the Exchange (including disciplinary matters). Because, following the Combination, the Exchange also will be owned indirectly by New BGM, instead<span class="printed_page" id="page-76503" data-page="76503"> </span>of only directly by DEI and indirectly by DE Holdings, the Exchange is proposing to expand this prohibition to cover both its direct and indirect parent companies. The Exchange believes that this amendment will protect the independence of the Exchange's self-regulatory activities.</li>
          <li id="p-359" data-page="76503"> Correcting certain typographical errors, including conforming the spelling of &ldquo;Bylaws&rdquo; throughout the organizational documents of the Exchange and its parent companies.</li>
</ul>
          <h4 id="h-29" class="">9.  Exchange Rule 2.3&mdash;Member Eligibility</h4>
          <p id="p-360" data-page="76503">Pursuant to Exchange Rule 2.3, in order to be eligible for membership in the Exchange, a registered broker or dealer is required to be a member of at least one other national securities association or national securities exchange. However, membership in the Exchange's affiliated national securities exchange, EDGA, is not sufficient for purposes of eligibility for Exchange membership. As a result of the Combination, the Exchange will additionally become affiliated with the BATS Exchanges. The Exchange continues to believe that it is appropriate to limit its membership to registered broker-dealers that are members of at least one national securities association or national securities exchange that is not affiliated with the Exchange. Therefore, the Exchange proposes to amend Exchange Rule 2.3 to specify that a registered broker-dealer will be eligible for membership only if it is a member of a national securities association or national securities exchange other than or in addition to BATS, BYX, or EDGA. The proposed amendments to Exchange Rule 2.3 are set forth in Exhibit 5I.</p>
          <h4 id="h-30" class="">10.  Exchange Rule 2.12&mdash;DE Route as Inbound Router</h4>
          <p id="p-361" data-page="76503">DE Route provides Members of the Exchange and EDGA with optional routing services to other market centers. Thus, in certain circumstances, DE Route provides inbound routing from EDGA to the Exchange. Exchange Rule 2.12 governs this inbound routing of orders by DE Route to the Exchange in DE Route's capacity as a facility of EDGA. Recognizing that the Commission has previously expressed concern regarding the potential for conflicts of interest in instances where a member firm is affiliated with an exchange to which it is routing orders, the Exchange has implemented limitations and conditions on DE Route's affiliation with the Exchange in order to permit the Exchange to accept inbound orders that DE Route routes in its capacity as a facility of EDGA. These conditions and limitations, set forth in Exchange Rule 2.12(a), require that:</p>
          <p id="p-362" data-page="76503">(1) The Exchange must enter into (a) a plan pursuant to Rule 17d-2 under the Act with a non-affiliated self-regulatory organization (&ldquo;SRO&rdquo;) to relieve the Exchange of regulatory responsibilities for DE Route with respect to rules that are common rules between the Exchange and the non-affiliated SRO, and (b) a regulatory services contract (&ldquo;Regulatory Contract&rdquo;) with a non-affiliated SRO to perform regulatory responsibilities for DE Route for unique Exchange rules.</p>
          <p id="p-363" data-page="76503">(2) The Regulatory Contract must require the Exchange to provide the non-affiliated SRO with information, in an easily accessible manner, regarding all exception reports, alerts, complaints, trading errors, cancellations, investigations, and enforcement matters (collectively &ldquo;Exceptions&rdquo;) in which DE Route is identified as a participant that has potentially violated Exchange or Commission Rules, and requires that the non-affiliated SRO provide a report, at least quarterly, to the Exchange quantifying all Exceptions in which DE Route is identified as a participant that has potentially violated Exchange or Commission rules.</p>
          <p id="p-364" data-page="76503">(3) The Exchange, on behalf of its parent company, must establish and maintain procedures and internal controls reasonably designed to ensure that DE Route does not develop or implement changes to its system based on non-public information obtained as a result of its affiliation with the Exchange, until such information is available generally to similarly situated Members of the Exchange.</p>
          <p id="p-365" data-page="76503">(4) The Exchange may furnish to DE Route only the same information and on the same terms as the Exchange makes available in the normal course of business to other users.<sup><a rel="footnote" id="citation-154" href="#footnote-154">
            [154]
          </a></sup>
            
          </p>
          
          <p id="p-367" data-page="76503">In addition, Exchange Rule 2.12(b) states that, provided the conditions in Exchange Rule 2.12(a) are complied with, and provided further that DE Route operates as an outbound router on behalf of EDGA on the same terms and conditions as it does for the Exchange, and in accordance with the rules of EDGA, DE Route may provide inbound routing services to the Exchange from EDGA.</p>
          <p id="p-368" data-page="76503">Similar to the role of DE Route with respect to the DE Exchanges, the Exchange understands that BATS Trading provides members of the BATS Exchanges with optional routing services to other market centers, which may include routing from a BATS Exchange to the Exchange. Following the Combination, it is expected that BATS Trading will continue to provide these routing services, which may involve routing to the Exchange. Because, following the Combination, BATS Trading will be affiliated with and potentially routing to the Exchange, the Exchange believes that the potential conflict of interest currently addressed by Exchange Rule 2.12 with respect to DE Route must also be addressed with respect to BATS Trading.</p>
          <p id="p-369" data-page="76503">The Exchange is therefore proposing to amend and expand Exchange Rule 2.12 such that substantially the same conditions and limitations that currently apply to the inbound routing of orders by DE Route apply to the inbound routing of orders by BATS Trading. The proposed amendments to Exchange Rule 2.12, as set forth in Exhibit 5K, would provide that, in order for the Exchange to accept inbound routed orders from BATS Trading, the conditions and limitations currently set forth in Exchange Rule 2.12 with respect to DE Route must also be satisfied with respect to BATS Trading.</p>
          <p id="p-370" data-page="76503">The Exchange believes that these proposed amendments will adequately manage the potential for a conflict of interest that could arise from BATS Trading routing orders to the Exchange. The Exchange expects to arrange that these conditions be met prior to the Closing so as to allow BATS Trading to continue routing to the Exchange following the Closing without interruption.<sup><a rel="footnote" id="citation-155" href="#footnote-155">
            [155]
          </a></sup>
            
          </p>
          
          <p id="p-372" data-page="76503">In addition, the language in Exchange Rule 2.12(a) leading into the four conditions described above incorrectly refers to the conditions being undertaken by &ldquo;each of the Exchange and DE Route.&rdquo; However, by their terms, the conditions contained in Exchange Rule 2.12 are undertaken only by the Exchange and, in one case, the Exchange on behalf of its parent company. The Exchange therefore proposes to delete the incorrect reference to DE Route.</p>
          <h4 id="h-31" class="">11.  Exchange Rule 2.10&mdash;Affiliation Between Exchange and a Member</h4>
          <h4 id="h-32" class="">a.  Affiliation With BATS Trading</h4>

          <p id="p-373" data-page="76503">Exchange Rule 2.10 provides that, subject to certain exceptions, without the prior approval of the Commission, (i) the Exchange or any entity with which the Exchange is affiliated (as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Act), may not directly or indirectly acquire or<span class="printed_page" id="page-76504" data-page="76504"> </span>maintain an ownership interest in a Member of the Exchange, and (ii) a Member of the Exchange may not be or become an affiliate of the Exchange, or an affiliate of any affiliate of the Exchange. BATS Trading is currently a Member of the Exchange. As a result of the Combination, (i) New BGM, an entity affiliated with the Exchange, will acquire and maintain an indirect ownership interest in BATS Trading, and (ii) BATS Trading will become an affiliate of the Exchange. Pursuant to Exchange Rule 2.10, the Exchange is seeking the Commission's prior approval to permit this affiliation.</p>
          <p id="p-374" data-page="76504">The Exchange notes that the purpose of Exchange Rule 2.10 is to prevent or manage potential conflicts of interest that could arise from the Exchange or its affiliates having an ownership interest in an Exchange Member, particularly with respect to the Exchange's obligation under Section 19(g) of the Act to enforce its Members' compliance with the Act, the Commission's rules thereunder, and Exchange Rules.<sup><a rel="footnote" id="citation-156" href="#footnote-156">
            [156]
          </a></sup>
            
          </p>
          
          <p id="p-376" data-page="76504">The Exchange believes that it should be permitted to become affiliated with BATS Trading, notwithstanding BATS Trading's Exchange membership. As described above, as a result of the proposed amendments to Exchange Rule 2.12, the Exchange intends on addressing the potential conflicts of interests arising from its expected affiliation with BATS Trading by, among other things, entering into (i) a plan pursuant to Rule 17d-2 under the Act with a non-affiliated SRO to relieve the Exchange of regulatory responsibilities for BATS Trading with respect to rules that are common rules between the Exchange and the non-affiliated SRO, and (ii) a Regulatory Contract with a non-affiliated SRO to perform regulatory responsibilities for BATS Trading for unique Exchange rules. The Exchange believes that any potential conflict of interest that would arise as a result of its affiliation with BATS Trading will be mitigated by the same procedures that the Exchange anticipates adopting to satisfy the proposed amendments to Exchange Rule 2.12. The Exchange therefore requests that, pursuant to Exchange Rule 2.10, the Commission approve the indirect acquisition of BATS Trading by an affiliate of the Exchange and the resulting affiliation between the Exchange and BATS Trading, so long as the requirements under Exchange Rule 2.12, as proposed to be amended, are satisfied.</p>
          <h4 id="h-33" class="">b.  Proposed Amendments to Exchange Rule 2.10</h4>
          <p id="p-377" data-page="76504">The Exchange also proposes to make several changes to Exchange Rule 2.10 to reflect the proposed change in the corporate structure of the Exchange after Closing. Specifically, Rule 2.10 currently states that nothing in Rule 2.10 shall prohibit a Member or its affiliate from acquiring or holding an equity interest in DE Holdings that is permitted by the DE Holdings Ownership and Voting Limitations. Furthermore, Rule 2.10 currently states that nothing in Rule 2.10 shall prohibit a Member from being or becoming an affiliate of the Exchange, or an affiliate of any affiliate of the Exchange, solely by reason of such Member or any officer, director, manager, managing member, partner or affiliate of such Member being or becoming a Director serving on the Board of Directors of DE Holdings. Because New BGM will replace DE Holdings as the ultimate parent company of the Exchange after Closing, New BGM's governing documents, as opposed to the revised DE Holdings governing documents, set forth the relevant ownership and voting limitations, and provide for Member representation on the New BGM Board. Therefore, the Exchange proposes to replace the references to DE Holdings and its governing documents in Rule 2.10 with references to New BGM and its governing documents. The proposed revisions to Exchange Rule 2.10 are set forth in Exhibit 5J.</p>
          <p id="p-378" data-page="76504">In addition, current Exchange Rule 2.10 states that nothing in this Rule shall prohibit the Exchange from being an affiliate of DE Route or of EDGA Exchange, Inc. Because the Exchange will be affiliated with BATS Trading and the BATS Exchanges, as well as DE Route and EDGA, after Closing, the Exchange proposes to expand this provision to specifically permit the Exchange's affiliation with BATS Trading and the BATS Exchanges.</p>
          <h4 id="h-34" class="">2.  Statutory Basis</h4>
          <p id="p-379" data-page="76504">The Exchange believes that the Proposed Rule Change is consistent with the requirements of the Act<sup><a rel="footnote" id="citation-157" href="#footnote-157">
            [157]
          </a></sup>
            and the rules and regulations thereunder that are applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, with the requirements of Section 6(b) of the Act.<sup><a rel="footnote" id="citation-158" href="#footnote-158">
            [158]
          </a></sup>
            In particular, the proposal is consistent with Section 6(b)(1) of the Act<sup><a rel="footnote" id="citation-159" href="#footnote-159">
            [159]
          </a></sup>
            in that it enables the Exchange to be so organized as to have the capacity to be able to carry out the purposes of the Act and to comply, and to enforce compliance by its Members and persons associated with its Members, with the provisions of the Act, the rules and regulations thereunder, and the Rules of the Exchange. The Proposed Rule Change is designed to enable the Exchange to continue to have the authority and ability to effectively fulfill its self-regulatory duties pursuant to the Act and the rules promulgated thereunder. In particular, the Proposed Rule Change includes in the New BGM Charter and New BGM Bylaws, like the Current BGM Charter and Current BGM Bylaws, various provisions intended to protect and maintain the integrity of the self-regulatory functions of the Exchange upon Closing. Including such provisions in the New BGM Charter and New BGM Bylaws is important because New BGM will be the new ultimate parent company of the Exchange. For example, the New BGM Bylaws, as described above, are drafted to preserve the independence of the Exchange's self-regulatory function and ensure that the Exchange is able to obtain information it needs from the specified parties to detect and deter any fraudulent and manipulative acts in its marketplace and carry out their regulatory responsibilities under the Act. In addition, the New BGM Charter and New BGM Bylaws are drafted to make sure that the Exchange's Board of Directors receives notice of any amendment to the New BGM Charter and New BGM Bylaws so that the Exchange's Board of Directors may review and approve, and the Exchange may make any filings with the Commission necessary for the Exchange to fulfill its regulatory duties under the Act. The New BGM Charter also imposes the BGM Ownership Limitation and BGM Voting Limitation to preclude undue influence over or interference with the Exchange's self-regulatory functions and fulfillment of its regulatory duties under the Act. Moreover, to the extent any protections are being deleted in any governing documents, there are adequate substitutes proposed to be implemented. For example, the deletion of the DE Holdings Ownership and Voting Limitations are being deleted, in favor of the BGM Ownership Limitation and the BGM Voting Limitation.</p>
          
          
          
          <p id="p-383" data-page="76504">Moreover, notwithstanding the Proposed Rule Change, including the change to the ownership structure of the Exchange, the Commission will continue to have regulatory authority<sup><a rel="footnote" id="citation-160" href="#footnote-160">
            [160]
          </a></sup>
            
            <span class="printed_page" id="page-76505" data-page="76505"> </span>over the Exchange, as is currently the case, as well as jurisdiction over the Exchange's direct and indirect parents with respect to activities related to the Exchange.<sup><a rel="footnote" id="citation-161" href="#footnote-161">
            [161]
          </a></sup>
            As a result, the Proposed Rule Change will facilitate an ownership structure that will provide the Commission with appropriate oversight tools to ensure that the Commission will have the ability to enforce the Act with respect to the Exchange, its direct and indirect parent entities and their directors (where applicable), officers, employees and agents to the extent they are involved in the activities of the Exchange.</p>
          
          
          <p id="p-386" data-page="76505">The Exchange also believes that the Proposed Rule Change furthers the objectives of Section 6(b)(5) of the Act.<sup><a rel="footnote" id="citation-162" href="#footnote-162">
            [162]
          </a></sup>
            The Proposed Rule Change is consistent with and facilitates a governance and regulatory structure that is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to foster cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in regulating, clearing, settling, processing information with respect to, and facilitating transactions in securities, to remove impediments to, and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market system and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest. The Proposed Rule Change provides transparency and certainty, and promotes efficiency, with respect to the governance and corporate structure of the Exchange and its direct and indirect parent companies. For example, the Exchange proposes to adopt an approach to corporate governance that is consistent with the approach taken by the BATS Exchanges and previously approved by the Commission.<sup><a rel="footnote" id="citation-163" href="#footnote-163">
            [163]
          </a></sup>
            The Exchange proposes to revise the Exchange Certificate of Incorporation and Exchange Bylaws to make them substantively consistent with the BATS Exchanges' existing governing documents. In addition, the Exchange proposes several amendments to the Exchange Bylaws that reflect changes that the BATS Exchanges propose to make to their Bylaws as a result of the Combination. The Exchange believes that these additional changes, among other things, will remove administrative impediments to, and reduce the potential for conflicts of interest in, the governance of the Exchange. By simplifying and unifying the governance structure of the four exchanges in this way, the Proposed Rule Change promotes the maintenance of a fair and orderly market, the protection of investors and the protection of the public interest.</p>
          
          
          <p id="p-389" data-page="76505">In addition, the Exchange expects that the Combination will facilitate efficiencies and innovation for clients and efficient, transparent and well-regulated markets for issuers and clients, thus removing impediments to, and perfecting the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market system. The Combination will benefit investors, the market as a whole, and shareholders by, among other things, enhancing competition among securities venues and reducing costs. In particular, the Combination will result in a third major exchange operator which will have more streamlined and efficient operations, including the transition of the DE Exchanges to a technology platform in common with the BATS Exchanges, thereby intensifying competition for transaction order flow with other exchange and non-exchange trading centers, as well as potentially in other areas where the two major exchange operators lead, such as proprietary market data products and listings. This enhanced level of competition among trading centers will benefit investors through new or more competitive product offerings and, ultimately, lower costs.</p>
          <p id="p-390" data-page="76505">Furthermore, the Exchange is not proposing any significant changes to its existing operational and trading structure in connection with the change in ownership; the Exchange will operate in essentially the same manner upon Closing as it operates today. Therefore, the Exchange believes that it will continue to satisfy the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder that are applicable to a national securities exchange. The changes the Exchange is proposing to Exchange Rules 2.3 are designed to extend the membership eligibility criteria in a way that is consistent with the current rule, taking into account the prospective affiliation with the BATS Exchanges. The proposed changes to Exchange Rules 2.12 and 2.10 are designed to address the potential for conflicts of interest due to the prospective affiliation between the Exchange and BATS Trading. The Exchange believes that these proposed changes to its Rules are consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder. The Exchange believes that these rule changes promote the maintenance of a fair and orderly market, the protection of investors and the public interest, and is in the best interests of the Exchange and its Members as it would continue to allow routing of orders between four affiliated exchanges.</p>
          <p id="p-391" data-page="76505">Finally, with the Proposed Rule Change, the Exchange emphasizes that it believes that the Proposed Rule Change is not inconsistent with the Order Instituting Administrative and Cease-and-Desist Proceedings Pursuant to Sections 19(h) and 21C of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions and Cease-and-Desist Order, entered by the Commission on October 13, 2011.<sup><a rel="footnote" id="citation-164" href="#footnote-164">

          <p id="p-393" data-page="76505">The Exchange does not believe that the Proposed Rule Change would result in any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. Indeed, the Exchange believes that the Proposed Rule Change will enhance competition among intermarket trading venues, as the Exchange believes that the Combination will produce a stronger and more efficient entity that will have an improved ability to provide innovative products and services. Moreover, the Exchange will continue to conduct regulated activities (including operating and regulating its market and Members) of the type it currently conducts, but will be able to do so in a more efficient manner to the benefit of its Members. Furthermore, the Exchange's conclusion that the Proposed Rule Change would not result in any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act<sup><a rel="footnote" id="citation-165" href="#footnote-165">
            [165]

              71. As noted previously, DE Holdings currently operates pursuant to the Sixth DE Holdings LLC Agreement. The Fourth DE Holdings LLC Agreement was the last version filed with and approved by the Commission. The Exchange and EDGA Boards determined that a rule filing was unnecessary to reflect the changes made to the Fourth DE Holdings LLC Agreement and the Fifth DE Holdings LLC Agreement. Specifically, the Fourth DE Holdings LLC Agreement or Fifth DE Holdings LLC Agreement was amended to reflect that (i) DE Holdings could issue options to purchase equity interests in DE Holdings to officers and employees in conjunction with an approved equity plan; (ii) because the DE Exchanges became national securities exchanges, a facility of ISE Stock Exchange LLC (&ldquo;ISE Exchange&rdquo;) ceased operations; (iii) the Commission had approved DEI as a wholly-owned subsidiary of DE Holdings and direct parent company of the DE Exchanges; (iv) certain rights and obligations related to the transaction in which ISE Holdings became an LLC Member of DE Holdings expired on December 23, 2010; (v) service agreements with certain LLC Members had been updated, and (vi) that Units of DE Holdings were held by Knight Capital Holdings LLC and not Knight Trimark, Inc., and Citadel Securities LLC and not Citadel Derivatives Group LLC. Therefore, to ensure regulatory continuity, the Exchange will discuss the changes it proposes to make to the Fourth DE Holdings LLC Agreement, rather than the Sixth DE Holdings LLC Agreement, to create the New DE Holdings LLC Agreement. As necessary, the Exchange notes where the Fourth DE Holdings LLC Agreement and the Sixth LLC Agreement differ as a result of one or more of the above categories of changes.</p>

              120. The Exchange also notes that paragraph 1 of Article SIXTH would be obsolete after the Closing. As discussed above in Section 7 of this Proposed Rule Change, Section 7.7 of the Fourth DE Holdings LLC Agreement sets forth the circumstances under which certain actions require supermajority board approval, majority board approval and/or the approval of a majority of all or a subset of LLC Members. Under the New DE Holdings LLC Agreement, DE Holdings will be managed by New BGM, as the Sole LLC Member, rather than a board. Because DE Holdings will only have one LLC Member after Closing, the provisions regarding majority and supermajority approval would be unnecessary. Accordingly, the Exchange proposes that DE Holdings delete Section 7.7 of the Fourth DE Holdings LLC Agreement. Correspondingly, the Exchange proposes to delete paragraph 1 of Article SIXTH as it would refer to provisions that no longer exists in the New DE Holdings LLC Agreement.</p>

The Exchange also notes that Article III, Section 4, Article IX, Section 1, and Article III, Section 7 of the Exchange Bylaws address the election of Directors, the amendment, alteration and repeal of the Exchange Bylaws and the removal of Directors, respectively. Therefore, the Exchange believes that the proposed deletions from Article SIXTH of the Exchange Certificate do not leave these areas unaddressed. Moreover, as discussed in Section 8(b) of this Proposed Rule Change, these provisions of the Exchange Bylaws also will be consistent with the bylaws of the BATS Exchanges.</p>
